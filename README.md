# RGAG

#Background.
As one of the important components of the ruminant gastrointestinal tract microbiome, archaea are involved in many biological processes, especially methanogenesis. However, the diversity and individual metabolic characteristics of archaea in this habitat remain largely understudied, partly due to the lack of a unified reference catalog. We hope to construct a set of ruminant gastrointestinal archaea genomes (RGAG) by collecting culturable archaea genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes.

#Instruction for use.
RGAG can be used as a reference for metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of ruminant gastrointestinal samples.
The 405 genomes of RGAG are deposited in 9 fasta files:
RGAG_Set1.fa;
RGAG_Set2.fa;
RGAG_Set3.fa;
RGAG_Set4.fa;
RGAG_Set5.fa;
RGAG_Set6.fa;
RGAG_Set7.fa;
RGAG_Set8.fa;
RGAG_Set9.fa;
